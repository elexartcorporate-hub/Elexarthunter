# PRD — Lead Hunter & Email Marketing Platform

## Original Problem Statement
Multi-tenant SaaS for lead generation and email marketing. Five modules: Dashboard, Hunter, Database, Email Marketing, Settings. Multi-tenant isolation via `tenant_id`. Multi-company hierarchy (sub-companies under one tenant with their own SMTP). Role-based access. Domain → company contact discovery with 7-step pipeline (Global Cache → Playwright Deep Crawl → Hunter.io → Merge → Dedupe → Confidence Scoring → Save).

User language: **Bahasa Indonesia** (respond in Indonesian).

## User Choices (verbatim)
- Auth: **JWT custom** (signup auto-creates tenant + Owner)
- Hunter.io: **MOCK** first, real API key swap-in via Settings
- Crawl engine: **Playwright real** (deep crawl)
- Email: **SMTP custom per sub-company** (or fallback tenant SMTP)
- Tracking: **Built-in** pixel + click-redirect
- Design: **Light SaaS aesthetic** (Indigo/Slate) — moved away from dark terminal theme per user request

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Motor + bcrypt + PyJWT + Playwright + smtplib (async)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + React Router 7 + Tailwind + Phosphor Icons + Sonner + Shadcn
- **DB**: MongoDB 7
- **Routing**: /api prefix; frontend SPA at /, /login, /register, /hunter, /database, /email, /settings
- **Infra**: Contabo VPS, Nginx, Let's Encrypt, Supervisor, auto-deploy bash script

## Core Requirements
1. Multi-tenant isolation via tenant_id from JWT
2. Sub-companies under one tenant, each with own SMTP + assigned users
3. Global hunter cache (cross-tenant) keyed by domain (<30d reuse)
4. 7-step Hunter pipeline with live UI feedback
5. Role-based access control (Owner / Admin / Staff + custom roles)
6. Email campaigns: pick sub-company SMTP, pick recipient source (my_leads / contacts / manual), tracking
7. Personal "My Leads" list per user

## Recent Changes (Feb 2026)
- **Templates UX overhaul (Phase 3, Feb 2026)**: Added `body_type` field (`html`|`plain`) to templates with toggle in UI, integrated **ReactQuill** WYSIWYG editor for HTML mode. Built template **attachment system** — files stored as base64 in MongoDB (`template_attachments` collection), max 8MB/file and 20MB/template. Endpoints: `POST /api/templates/{tid}/attachments` (multipart upload), `DELETE /api/templates/{tid}/attachments/{att_id}`, `GET /api/templates/{tid}/attachments/{att_id}/download`. Duplicate cascades attachments; delete cascades cleanup. Email sending in all paths (bulk, single, outreach task, scheduled worker) now auto-loads template `body_type` and `attachments` and sends with proper MIME `multipart/mixed` + `multipart/alternative` structure.
- **Anti-spam email service rewrite (Feb 2026)**: `send_smtp_email` now sets `Message-ID` (with sender's domain), `Date`, `MIME-Version`, `X-Mailer`, `Reply-To`, `List-Unsubscribe` + `List-Unsubscribe-Post: One-Click` headers. HTML bodies are wrapped with proper `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>…</head><body>…</body></html>` if not already wrapped. Plain-text fallback (`multipart/alternative`) is always generated from HTML. Attachments use `multipart/mixed` with base64 transfer encoding. Tracking pixel only injected for HTML body_type (plain text doesn't get `<img>` tags).
- **Inbox Module Phase 2 (Feb 2026)**: Folder support (INBOX/Sent/Trash) with dynamic resolution via IMAP SPECIAL-USE flags + common-name fallback. Endpoints: `GET /api/inbox/{sc_id}?folder=…&limit=20`, `GET /api/inbox/{sc_id}/message/{uid}` (returns full body + auto-marks Seen), `POST /api/inbox/{sc_id}/mark`, `POST /api/inbox/{sc_id}/reply` (proper `In-Reply-To` + `References` threading + APPEND to Sent folder).
- **Settings modal overflow fix**: ModalShell rewritten to use `overflow-y-auto` on outer fixed overlay + `min-h-full flex items-start` wrapper. Modal headers/footers reachable at all viewport sizes including 1366x768.
